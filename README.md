 Movie Central â€“ A Movie Management System
 
Project Date:June 2024  
Tech Stack: Java, MySQL, JDBC, REST API, JSON

Overview
Movie Central is a Java-based backend application designed to manage a collection of movies and users. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on movies, manage user data, and integrate with external APIs to fetch real-time movie information. The system uses MySQL for data storage, JDBC for database connectivity, and JSON for API communication.

 Features
 1.Movie Management:
  Add, update, delete, and search for movies stored in the database.

 2.User Management:  
  Maintain records of users and track their interactions with the movie system.

  3.REST API Integration:
  Connects to third-party APIs (like TMDB or OMDb) to fetch dynamic movie details such as posters, ratings, and release info.

  4.Data Storage (MySQL + JDBC): 
  Efficient relational database design with JDBC-based operations for real-time access and manipulation.

   5.JSON Support:  
  Handles all API data exchange in JSON format, enabling modern and lightweight communication.
